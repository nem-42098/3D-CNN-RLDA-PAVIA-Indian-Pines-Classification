# CNN_RLDA_PAVIA_Indian_Pines_Classification
This repository contains implementation of ideas presented in the following three papers:
 
 *[Principal Component Discriminant Analysis for Feature Extraction and Classification of Hyperspectral Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6802535)
 
 *[Classification of Hyperspectral Images with Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4786582)
 
 *[HybridSN: Exploring 3D-2D CNN Feature Hierarchy for Hyperspectral Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06701)
 
 The performance of these algorithms are tested on publicaly available dataset of [Indian Pines](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/2/22/Indian_pines.mat) and [Pavia University](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/e/ee/PaviaU.mat)
 
 The aim of the study consisted of two obejctives:
 1. Introduce novelty in the presented ideas in the first two papers to improve prediction accuracy.
 2. Showcase imporvement in classification accuracy by using Deep-Learning over traditional Machine Learning methods

Please refer to Report.docx for further information about implementation procedure,theoretical background and results achieved.
